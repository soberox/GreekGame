# Greek game
  Over the summer, I worked on this Greek clicker game as a foray into game design. I chose Godot as my game engine because of its open-source nature and beginner-friendly scripting. I went with a Greek aesthetic to create a recognizable and fun backdrop for your adventure.
  
  When you start the game, you’ll be dropped into the home tab. As you continue collecting and selling, you’ll earn experience. With enough experience, you can unlock new facets of this world and eventually reach prestige, where you can sail forth to new lands and continue being a kingmaker!
  
  I definitely learned a lot from this project, and I plan to keep improving the presentation of the game with the goal of eventually releasing a polished version.
